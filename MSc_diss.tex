\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
The Earth’s atmosphere is the recipient of a vast range of chemical compounds emitted by natural and anthropogenic sources. The oxidation of these compounds is the main process taking place in the atmosphere that keeps their concentrations at levels that do not distort the chemical balance of the atmosphere \citep{Prinn2003}. In other words, oxidation is a removal “cleansing” mechanism for these compounds (various pollutants and greenhouse gases), and its rate is often referred to as the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere. This capacity depends mainly on two factors: the global burden of the principal oxidants such as ozone ($O_3$), the hydroxyl radical ($OH$) and hydrogen peroxide ($H_2O_2$), and climate \citep{Prinn2003,Thompson1992}.

\subsection{Tropospheric ozone}
Tropospheric ozone ($O_3$) plays an important role in the chemical and thermal balance of the atmosphere. Although it accounts only for about 10\% of the total ozone, it is a primary precursor to the formation of hydroxyl radicals ($OH$) which in association with hydrogen peroxide ($H_2O_2$) determines the ‘cleansing’ capacity of the atmosphere \citep{Prinn2003,Tarasick2008,Thompson1992}. On the other hand, being a source of the main pollutant removal agents, ozone is an air pollutant itself. Long exposure to its high concentrations causes respiratory problems in humans and damage to sensitive plant species \citep{Fowler2008}. Last but not least characteristic of tropospheric ozone is that it is an important greenhouse gas with a current estimated radiative forcing of  $0.40\pm 0.20~Wm^{–2}$ which is approximately one fifth of the $CO_2$ radiative forcing \citep{Hartmann2013,Myhre2013}. Due to these reasons a considerable interest in quantifying tropospheric ozone concentrations, budget and trends exists for more than a 100 years \citep{Becker2004}.

Unlike many other air pollutants, tropospheric ozone is not directly emitted, but produced following the oxidation of carbon monoxide ($CO$), methane ($CH_4$), and nonmethane volatile compounds (nmVOCs) in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx) \citep{Crutzen1973,Myhre2013}. The emissions of these precursors arise from both natural and anthropogenic sources which have increased/intensified since pre-industrial times \citep{Parrish2014,Volz1988} (Figure 1). Presumably it has led to a roughly doubling in background tropospheric ozone concentration \citep{Guicherit2000,Hartmann2013,Tarasick2008,Vingarzan2004}, although contribution from another major source, transport from the stratosphere, may also took place \citep{Fowler2008}. Climate is also believed to be a key driver of ozone production and destruction since the chemical reactions affecting ozone concentration are strongly dependent on such climatic factors as temperature, rainfall and humidity. Therefore in a changing climate tropospheric ozone is not anymore a local air quality issue, but is a global pollution problem \citep{Fowler2008}.

\caption{Observed surface ozone at different Northern Hemispheric surface stations \citep{Isaksen2009}.}
\label{fig:ratio_curves}
\end{figure}

According to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment report (AR5) for present (about 2000) conditions the global mean tropospheric ozone budget is approximately 331 Tg \citep{Myhre2013}. However, despite general agreement on how the drivers impact ozone concentrations at global and regional scales, its budget varies considerably between different modelling and observational studies \citep{Stevenson2006,Wild2007,Young2012}. Table 1 demonstrates that the range of the global tropospheric ozone burden estimates is approximately 60 Tg which is 18\% of the mean. In terms of ozone production the variation is even higher and account for 28\% of the corresponding value. In that regard, two questions arise: why does the tropospheric ozone budget differ between models and observations? And secondly, why does it vary to this extent, especially in terms of production? The only way to answer these questions is to perform a rigorous investigation of the factors that drive tropospheric ozone and attribute those differences to respective factors \citep{Young2012}.

A considerable effort has been made to tackle these problems, and generally there are two possible ways of doing it. The first one implies the direct analysis of tropospheric chemical schemes used in climate-chemistry models. For example, Emmerson and Evans (2009) compared the state of the art Master Chemical Mechanism which contains approximately 5600 species and 13500 reactions \citep{Jenkin2002} with other six chemical schemes and found four significant variations between them. This approach is linked with big challenges since a modern global model is a very sophisticated representation of the climate-chemistry interactions, and therefore it is often difficult to separate influence of one reaction from another. However, even being so developed climate-chemistry models do not take into account all known chemical reactions taking place in the real troposphere. A complete representation requires many thousands of species and tens of thousands of reactions, which is beyond the numerical capabilities currently available. This significantly limits the practicable size of chemical schemes and typically involves a reduction of the number of VOCs considered and lumping the carbon from the discarded species into representative surrogates.

The second way to understanding the discrepancies between models and observations is to conduct an idealised theoretical study using a conceptual model. The advantage of this approach is that such kind of models can be quite easily constructed, and more importantly can be focused on representation of a certain chemical reactions which presumably could explain the discrepancy between models and observations. An example of such set of reactions is alkyl nitrate chemistry.

\subsection{Alkyl nitrates}
Alkyl nitrates are important tropospheric trace gases which are formed following the same chemistry that leads to the production of ozone \citep{Reeves2007}. The simplest example, in case of $CH_4$ oxidation, can be described by the set of reactions below (also shown in Figure 2).

%\input{O3CycleScheme}

In the presence of UV light shorter than 320 nm and water vapour $O_3$ photolysis is the main source of OH radicals in the troposphere:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:O3hv}
O_3 + hv \rightarrow O(^1D) + O_2
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:O1D+H2O}
O(^1D) + H_2O \rightarrow 2OH
\end{equation}
Once formed the OH radicals react mainly with $CO$ and $CH_4$ to initiate the $O_3$ formation or removal cycles by producing peroxy radicals ($HO_2$, $CH_3O_2$):
\begin{equation} \label{eq:OH+CO}
OH + CO \rightarrow HO_2 + CO_2
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:OH+CH4}
OH + CH_4 \rightarrow CH_3O_2 + H_2O
\end{equation}

The fate of the peroxy radicals depends on the presence of NOx. At low NOx levels (remote regions), the $HO_2$ radical reacts with another HO2 to form hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, or with the methyl peroxy radical, $CH_3O_2$, to form methyl hydrogen peroxide ($CH_3OOH$):
\begin{equation} \label{eq:HO2+HO2}
HO_2 + HO_2 \rightarrow H_2O_2 + O_2
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:HO2+CH3O2}
HO_2 + CH_3O_2 \rightarrow CH_3OOH + O_2
\end{equation}
On a whole, at low NOx levels a net $O_3$ loss takes place, because the reaction sequence is initiated by $O_3$ photolysis. Plus under the same conditions, some additional $O_3$ removal occurs due to the re-action of $HO_2$ radicals with $O_3$,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:HO2+O3}
HO_2 + O_3 \rightarrow OH + 2O_2
\end{equation}
leading to the regeneration of OH radicals as part of an $O_3$ depleting HOx catalytic cycle.

At intermediate NOx levels (rural areas of most industrialised countries), the peroxy radicals react with nitrogen monoxide ($NO$) to form nitrogen dioxide ($NO_2$) with the subsequent photolysis of $NO_2$ generating $O_3$:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:HO2+NO}
HO_2 + NO \rightarrow NO_2 + OH
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:CH_3O_2+NO}
CH_3O_2 + NO \rightarrow NO_2 + CH_3O
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:NO2hv}
NO_2 + hv \rightarrow NO + O(^3P)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:O3P+O2}
O(^3P) + O_2 + M \rightarrow O_3 + M
\end{equation}
As it is shown in Figure 2 reactions (8) and (9) form part of the free-radical propagated $O_3$ forming cycles, which may occur a number of times before being halted by a radical termination reactions (not shown). However, the reaction of $CH_3O_2$ with NO is a two-channel reaction \citep{Day2003}, and its second branch can terminate the $O_3$ forming cycle earlier by producing an alkyl nitrate, in this case methyl nitrate ($CH_3ONO_2$):
\begin{equation} \label{eq:CH3NO3form}
CH_3O_2 + NO \rightarrow CH_3ONO_2
\end{equation}

Being a reservoir for the short lived NOx and having atmospheric lifetimes ranging from several days to about a month \citep{Reeves2007} alkyl nitrates can be transported over long distances, and then lost through photolysis and reaction with $OH$:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:CH3NO3hv}
CH_3ONO_2 + hv \rightarrow CH_3O + NO_2
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:CH3NO3+OH}
CH_3ONO_2 + OH \rightarrow HCHO + NO_2
\end{equation}
It means that alkyl nitrates can ‘release’ $NO_2$ back to the atmosphere after a while, and in association with reactions (10) and (11) start a new $O_3$ formation cycle being quite away from the source.

The free-radical propagated oxidation of hydrocarbons leads to the generation of carbonyl compounds, in this case formaldehyde ($HCHO$). Its further oxidation and photolysis contributes to radical generation:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:HCHOhv1}
HCHO + hv \rightarrow 2HO_2 + CO
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:HCHOhv2}
HCHO + hv \rightarrow CO + H_2
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:HCHO+OH}
HCHO + OH \rightarrow HO_2 + CO
\end{equation}
As a result, the formation of $HCHO$ has an impact on the rates of the oxidation cycles described above, through secondary radical generation \citep{Fowler2008}.
At high NOx levels (urban environment) reactions (8) and (9) dominate for $CH_3O_2$ and $HO_2$, but $O_3$ formation becomes inhibited by further increases in NOx. In other words, at high NOx regime the $O_3$ formation rate becomes sensitive to the concentration of $CH_4$ or $CO$ and to inputs of other VOCs \citep{Fowler2008}.

To sum up, alkyl nitrates are produced as a minor branch of the reaction of peroxy radicals with NO \citep{Day2003}. Since these compounds are removed from the troposphere by photolysis and OH oxidation they can provide information on photochemical evolution of an air mass through relationships with their parent hydrocarbons \citep{Bertman1995}. Acting as reservoir species for reactive nitrogen (NOy) and having a relatively long atmospheric lifetimes alkyl nitrates play an important role in long range transport of NOx. Furthermore, alkyl nitrates link to ozone and carbonyl production making them useful tracers for both species \citep{Worton2010}. Despite their relative importance alkyl nitrates are usually not included in the climate-chemistry models, for example in UKCA (Reeves, personal communication), which potentially could lead to discrepancies between models and observations described before.

\section{Literature review} \label{sec:data}
Alkyl nitrates ($RONO_2$) are organic tropospheric trace gases. They are produced photochemically through the oxidation of their parent hydrocarbons \citep{Roberts1990} or emitted directly from equatorial oceans \citep{Blake2003} and biomass burning \citep{Simpson2002}. Being involved in the ozone production chemistry, these species can act as reservoirs of nitrogen oxides which availability largely affects the production of ozone \citep{Reeves2007}. Since the alkyl nitrates have atmospheric lifetimes ranging from several days to about a month, they can redistribute nitrogen oxides presented over polluted continental regions to clean remote marine environments, and therefore are considered as one of the tracers for determining the anthropogenic influence \citep{Atherton1989, Reeves2007, Worton2005}.

Alkyl nitrates are removed from the atmosphere by photolysis \citep{Turberg1990} or through oxidation by hydroxyl radical ($OH$) \citep{Talukdar1997}. Photolysis is the dominant loss mechanism for the compounds with short carbon chains and becomes more important with decreasing carbon number. Reaction with $OH$ follows the opposite trend and is most important for the pentyl nitrates and higher.

Owing to the existence of the relationship between alkyl nitrates and their parent hydrocarbons, measurements of their concentrations can provide information on the extent of photochemical processing in the air mass. \cite{Bertman1995} developed a kinetic approach to describe this relationship through the evolution of the ratio of alkyl nitrate to its parent hydrocarbon as a function of time. This approach has been extensively used to study air mass photochemical ageing at several sites, in North America \citep{Bertman1995, Roberts1998}, China \citep{Simpson2006}, the British Isles \citep{Worton2010} and over the Pacific \citep{Simpson2003} and North Atlantic Ocean \citep{Reeves2007}.

\cite{Bertman1995} found that the theoretical ratios of  2-butyl nitrate to n-butane and 2- and 3-pentyl nitrates to pentane strongly agree with those measured from the ambient air showing no evidence for primary sources of these nitrates. On the contrary, measurements of the other ratios, ethyl/ethane, n-propyl nitrate/propane, and 2-propyl nitrate/propane, appeared to be significantly higher than predicted, relative to the 2-butyl nitrate/n-butane ratio, meaning that there should be an additional source of these alkyl nitrates. \cite{Roberts1998} generally approved the theory by comparing Bertman's conclusions with the results from a new observational dataset.

Using methyl nitrate as a tracer of marine $RONO_2$ \cite{Simpson2006} revealed that the South China Sea in not a region of strong $RONO_2$ emissions suggesting that photochemical rather marine production of alkyl nitrates is dominant at the site.

\cite{Worton2010} found that the photochemical source of the short-chain alkyl nitrates originates mostly from the photochemical oxidation and decomposition of longer-chain compounds rather than from the oxidation of the parent hydrocarbons as it is thought in the previous studies.

The brief description of the measurement sites and data is presented in section \ref{sec:data}. In section \ref{sec:method} the methodology used in this work is defined. Section \ref{sec:res} contains the results. Section \ref{sec:discuss} discusses the results, particularly focusing attention on the analysis of the discrepancy between the observational data and the results of theoretical modelling. Conclusions constitute section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Methodology} \label{sec:method}
\subsection{Model development}
A one box model was developed to investigate the impact of alkyl nitrate chemistry on ozone production efficiency. It will be written using the programming language FACSIMILE.

\subsection{Photolysis rate coefficients}
From MCMv3.3.

\subsection{Design of experiments}
Hypothesis: ANs have an impact on O3.

To test the hypothesis box model runs were performed at a series of different NOx and VOCs initial concentrations, so that an $O_3$ isopleth plot could be constructed, similar to those found in \citep{Dodge1977} and \citep{Sillman1999}. The following initial concentrations were used:

\subsection{Bertman}
Below is the simplified scheme of atmospheric hydrocarbon oxidation leading to the formation of alkyl nitrates (see also Fig. \ref{fig:scheme_bertman}). It begins from the process of $H$ abstraction by the $OH$ radical where the fraction of the primary or secondary radical is denoted by $\alpha_1$.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:alkane_oh}
RH + \bullet OH \xrightarrow{k_1, \alpha_1} R\bullet + H_2O
\end{equation}
The resulting radical rapidly reacts with $O_2$ and forms an alkyl peroxy radical ($R\bullet$):
\begin{equation} \label{eq:rad_o2}
R\bullet + O_2 \xrightarrow{k_2} ROO\bullet
\end{equation}
Then the alkyl peroxy radical reacts with $NO$, when it can either lose an oxygen atom to form alkoxy radical ($RO\bullet$) or bond with $NO$ to form an alkyl nitrate. The former reaction is a crucial in the net production of tropospheric ozone, since photolysis of $NO_2$ is the main photochemical source of $O_3$ in the troposphere.
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:peroxy_no0}
\begin{align}
ROO\bullet + NO &\xrightarrow{k_3, (1-\alpha_3)} RO\bullet + NO_2 \label{eq:peroxy_no1}\\
ROO\bullet + NO &\xrightarrow{k_3, \alpha_3} RONO_2 \label{eq:peroxy_no2}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
In other words, a branching ratio $\alpha_3$ of the reactions between alkyl peroxy radicals and $NO$ leads to formation of nitrate products via rearrangement of a high-energy intermediate \citep{Bertman1995}. The branching ratio $\alpha_3$ is larger when the parent alkane is larger and is a function of temperature and pressure.

Apart from $NO$, alkyl peroxy radicals can react with each other and give peroxides, without formation of nitrates. As the eqs. \eqref{eq:peroxy_no0} outline, whether $ROO\bullet$ will bond with nitrates or with other peroxy radicals depends partially on $NO$ concentration. The reaction between $ROO\bullet$ and $NO$ is more likely when nitrate concentration is high.

The alkyl nitrates are removed from the atmosphere through photolysis and reaction with hydroxyl radical.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:an_photo}
RONO_2 + h\nu \xrightarrow{j_4} RO\bullet + NO_2
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:an_oh}
RONO_2 + OH \xrightarrow{k_5} \mathit{products}
\end{equation}
The relative importance of these two loss reactions depends generally on the net UV intensity and the size of the carbon chain in alkyl nitrates. Photolysis is relatively more important for nitrates with $< C_4$, while nitrates with longer chains ($\geq C_5$) tend to react faster with $OH$. In case of butyl nitrates both mechanisms are of similar significance \citep{Worton2010}.

Assuming that the only source of alkyl nitrates is the $OH$ reaction with alkane, and that reactions take place in $NO$-rich atmosphere (so no $ROO\bullet$ self-reactions occur), the alkyl nitrate part in this generalised scheme can be reduced to the two equations of formation and loss:
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:an_form_loss0}
\begin{align}
RH &\xrightarrow{\beta k_A} RONO2 \label{eq:an_form_loss1}\\
RONO_2 &\xrightarrow{k_B} \mathit{products} \label{eq:an_form_loss2}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $k_A = k_1[OH]$ and $k_B=j_4 + k_5[OH]$. The factor $\beta=\alpha_1\alpha_3$ takes into account the fraction of $H$ atom abstraction from the particular hydrocarbon (with the reaction rate $k_1$) and the branching ratios leading to the nitrate. The photolytic loss rate of $RONO_2$ is denoted by $j_4$, and $k_5$ is the rate of alkyl nitrate destruction by $OH$.

These kinetic equations lead to the ordinary differential equations which can be integrated in time ($t$) giving a relationship between the alkyl nitrates and their parent alkanes concentrations:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:integral}
\frac{[RONO_2]}{[RH]} = \frac{\beta k_A}{k_B - k_A}\left(1-e^{(k_A - k_B)t}\right)+\frac{[RONO_2]_0}{[RH]_0}e^{(k_A - k_B)t}
\end{equation}
where subscript $0$ denotes the initial concentrations.

A further good approximation is that there is no alkyl nitrate initially (\textit{i.e.} no direct emissions), hence, the second term in eq. (\eqref{eq:integral}) becomes zero. Finally, the evolution of alkyl nitrates in an air mass can be modelled using the following formula.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:model}
\frac{[RONO_2]}{[RH]} = \frac{\beta k_A}{k_B - k_A}\left(1-e^{(k_A - k_B)t}\right)
\end{equation}
It has to be noted that eq. \eqref{eq:model} assumes no mixing with surrounding air. This simplification is reasonable only when mixing affects both the parent alkane and the corresponding alkyl nitrate similarly, keeping the ratios in eqs. \eqref{eq:integral} and \eqref{eq:model} the same \citep{Reeves2007}.
